## Florida Murder Rates (2005-2014)

This plot depicts the reported cases of murder and negligent manslaughter in the cities of **Tampa, FL** and **Miami, FL**. The city of Tampa is denoted in black, while the city of Miami is denoted in red. Historical data seems to show that Tampa is relatively safer than Miami, with murder statistics that have remained consistently lower than Miami throughout the designated time period. The data source utilized can be accessed [here](https://data.nola.gov/api/views/kirw-4rbx/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD).


## Rick and Morty Characters
![rickandmortycharacterstatus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70280666/138797196-a2d25247-2a72-4bbf-93c1-fae94868bac7.jpg)

On a lighter note, this pie chart displays the status of characters in the TV show Rick and Morty, where possible statuses range from:
1. *Alive*
1. *Dead*
1. *Unknown*

The distribution between these statuses appears fairly balanced. However, due to the incorporation of multiverse theory in the storyline, one could rightfully argue that all characters should **actually** all be categorized as *Alive*. This paradigm potentially suggests there exists infinite versions of all characters, existing in parallel dimensions. The data used to generate this data visualization can be found [here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/).
